# Code-Challenge-Bot-Battlr

# Description
This is a react application that displays a list of bots. A user should be able to;

1. See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.
2. Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should
   render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.
   The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.
3. Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the
  `YourBotArmy` component.
4. Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked
  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the
  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.

# Set Up/ Installation 

Clone the repository or download the source code.

Run this command to get the backend started:

```sh
json-server --watch db.json -p 8001
```

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

[http://localhost:8001/bots](http://localhost:8001/bots)

Then, Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

 ```sh
  npm start
  ```
Starts the development server.
    
 ```sh
  npm run build
  ```
Bundles the app into static files for production.
    
 ```sh
  npm test
  ```
Starts the test runner.
    
 ```sh
  npm run eject
  
  ```
Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
    

We suggest that you begin by typing:
 ```sh
  cd name of driectory

  ```
